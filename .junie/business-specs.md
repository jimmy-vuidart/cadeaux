# Cadeaux VUIDART

This app is a very small app, dedicated for my family, to handle the gift lists

## Home page

This page will simply display a page describing quickly the app, and allow with a button to create a new gift list

## Gift list page

URL : /lists/<id>

On this page, the user will be able to view all gifts added to the list, and add new gift. By default, the user only sees the gifts with no additional informations.

On the list, a button will allow to pass the list in "fill" mode. This mode is a "spoiler", allowing everyone else to pick a gift as "bought already" using a check list.

### Gifts URL (optional)

- When adding a gift, the user can optionally provide a URL to the product/page.
- When a gift has a URL, its title is displayed as a clickable link that opens in a new tab.
- When no URL is provided, the title is shown as plain text.
