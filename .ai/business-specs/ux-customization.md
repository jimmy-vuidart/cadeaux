# App UX Customization and Consistency

## Overview
The app’s user experience (UX) is centrally configurable. Product owners can tune the visual theme, component density, and motion preferences without touching page code.

## What can be customized
- Theme mode: Choose between automatic (follows device), light, or dark.
- Brand colors: Adjust the brand palette to match identity.
- Density: Choose comfortable or compact layout to fit more items on screen if needed.
- Motion: Respect device preferences and optionally reduce or prefer motion.
- Shape: Adjust the global roundness of UI elements.

## Shared UI building blocks
- Buttons: Primary and secondary buttons with consistent states and accessibility.
- Cards: Standard container for sections and panels. Cards can optionally be presented in a more festive style to highlight important actions or sections (e.g., gradient border, ribbon underline for titles, or a subtle confetti background).
- Inputs: Text inputs and textareas styled consistently across the app.

## Principles
- Consistency: All pages share the same look‑and‑feel through shared components and tokens.
- Accessibility: Focus states are clearly visible; motion respects user preferences.
- Brandability: Key visual aspects (colors, density, shape) can be changed from a central place.

## How teams use it
- Configure the global UX in one place (no page‑by‑page tweaking).
- Compose pages using shared UI components (Button, Card, Inputs) for consistent behavior and appearance.

## A more fancy and fun experience
- The interface embraces a gift‑giving spirit with cheerful colors, playful highlights, and light celebratory details that can be enabled where they add joy (e.g., confetti for success messages or a ribbon underline on headings).
- The experience remains practical and family‑friendly: readable, fast, and inclusive, with strong contrast and clear interactions.
